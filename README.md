# XMIHandler

This library provides a Java representation and parser for XMI. Being currently under development, currently targets the support of XMI files exported from ArgoUML.

The library is currently a NetBeans project, so just download and open in NetBeans to test/use.

There are currently neither documentation nor guides as the project is still incomplete.
